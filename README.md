### Build and run the project

In the root of the proyect run `pnpm i` in your terminal for install the dependencies
(_If you not have [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) download [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/es) and execute `npm i -g pnpm`_)

You have 3 options for build and run the proyect

- Transpiled version (recommended): `pnpm run build` and `pnpm run start`
- Execute with dev mode: `pnpm run build:watch` and `pnpm run dev` (in other terminal)****
